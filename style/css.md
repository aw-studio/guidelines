# CSS

## Naming

<p>Format: Customer Abbreviation-Function<br />
Examples: cwl-button, bsl-nav, gtp-toggle<br />
Including the customer abbreviation makes it clear that the class is custom.</p>

## Location

<p>Custom classes are created in a file with the same name.<br />
The files are located in the folder resources -> scss -> extend.<br />
The files are imported into app.scss in alphabetical order.</p>

## Typography

<p>The typography is primarily defined via the Tailwind Config.<br />
The design (e.g. Sketch) contains and sets the default parameters.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<p>The element rules for font family, sizes, weights, colors and margins are collected in a typography.scss file.</p>
